				<p class="column-1-text"><strong>Black Country, New Road - For the First Time</strong><br>Black Country, New Road are one of the most exciting bands in a standout London music scene, and this album is a candid portrait of where the band are at a few years into their existence. A cohesive forty minute LP, For the first time inhabits a sonic world of its own. Older singles have been re-recorded, and live favourites are finally available on disc. Now a septet, with Luke Mark joining on second guitar, the band’s last couple of years have been characterised by a succession of curveballs as they grow in confidence and come of age. The band are caught constantly somewhere between epochal genius and ironic aesthetic left turns. Never before has an album this good been released with an album cover this crap.</p>

				<p class="column-2-text"><strong>Maria Arnal i Marcel Bagés - CLAMOR</strong><br>After a debut album that reinterpreted Iberian folk for a contemporary audience, the Catalan duo turns toward the future, adding electronics and collaborating with Holly Herndon and Kronos Quartet. CLAMOR, the second album from Catalan duo Maria Arnal i Marcel Bagés, offers dazzling proof of the old adage that sometimes you need to go back to go forward. On CLAMOR, Arnal and Bagés take their inquisitive inclinations into bold new territory. While the material on their debut was built up over a period of time, CLAMOR was born from a desire—inspired by romantic separation, post-tour exhaustion, and a looming fascination with apocalypse and rebirth—to wipe the slate clean and make something genuinely new. The album may take its inspirations from endings, but it finds its strength in what comes next. What comes after the apocalypse? How do you fill the hole of a broken heart? And where do you go after the success of your well-defined debut album? The answer, on CLAMOR, is upwards, outwards, and beyond.</p>

				<p class="column-3-text"><b>Mabe Fratti - Será que ahora podremos entendernos</b><br>The Guatemalan musician’s second album explores the friction between interiority and exteriority; blooming with ecstatic synth riffs and spirited cello, the record captures the sound of a mind abuzz. abe Fratti’s debut album, 2019’s Pies Sobre la Tierra, focused on the distance between the physical world and the world inside one’s head. Her second, Será que ahora podremos entendernos, does too, delving even further into the friction between interiority and exteriority. With Fratti’s quaking cello as their ground, the record’s nine tracks flicker in the discontinuity between a thought and its outward expression, oscillating between feelings of hope and apprehension. But just because it’s pensive doesn’t mean it’s restrained; the record blooms with ecstatic synth riffs and unselfconscious bowing, capturing the sound of a mind buzzing at the threshold of some great vision. Again and again Fratti wonders, almost as a thought experiment, what it would be like to be understood absolutely. She is an economical writer and as a singer tends to repeat words and draw out syllables until her lyrics transform into abstract tones. Every song, barring the record’s three instrumental tracks, depicts just a single introspective moment or passing encounter with an imagined other. She rarely references the world outside of those moments of communion; when she does, it’s only to tether them to an elemental image like the sea, the moon, or the air. The effect is that of someone who is trying to pin down the act of communication like a specimen under glass—to turn it into an object she can turn over with her hands, inspect, and manipulate.

			In a nod to the late '60s, Danelectro offers up the '67 Dano. This cool solidbody captures the vintage look, feel, and tone of the early days of rock 'n' roll with its spirited offset body design â€” a nod to the days of surf rock and the beginnings of the "garage band" craze. The '67 Dano is constructed from an alder body that is lightweight and delivers a signature, jangly midrange tone. In addition, a maple neck with pau ferro fingerboard offers wonderful playability and response. And when you plug in, Lipstick single-coil passive pickups deliver a gorgeous vintage tone.
